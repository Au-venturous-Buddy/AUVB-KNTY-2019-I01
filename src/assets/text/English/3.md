<h3>"Milky Chiz" Ice Cream</h3>

And of course, we should leave some room for dessert! Tori Chizu offers the "Milky Chiz" Ice Cream, which is a soft-serve ice cream that taste as if you're either eating Cheez Whiz or butter straight to your mouth! They usually serve it either in cones or in cups, but more recently, they introduced Milky Chiz sundae cups with two flavors â€“ Ube and Double Cheese. Either way, the Milky Chiz soft-serve ice cream is definitely worth trying!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In general, Tori Chizu is a very creative restaurant. While there are indeed rooms for improvement, such as their Hambagu patties, their dishes (and most especially their Cheez-Whiz-tasting ice cream) are definitely worth coming back for! And above all, to all the interior design fans out there, the red fluorescent lamps on the ceiling would definitely make you feel warm and cozy as if youâ€™re literally inside an oven.

(Unfortunately, that Tori Chizu branch closed a few days before I managed to post this blog. However, there are still Tori Chizu branches out there in Metro Manila, so it's not too late for you to try out all my yummy recommendations from their menu! ðŸ™‚)
