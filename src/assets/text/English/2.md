<h3>Hambagu</h3>
Tori Chizu used the term "Hambagu" to refer to their hamburger-based dishes, and they do come either on rice or sandwiched between two slices of bread with the usual hamburger fix-ins. But I'm more curious about Tori Chizu's Hambagu Rice Dishes, which comes with flavors such as Sun-Dried Tomato, Swiss Mushroom, and (the one which I got to try out) Pineapple-Bacon. While I found the hamburger patty itself not very juicy (in fact, when I tried to cut into one, it was quite tough), the accompaniments (the grilled pineapple, Canadian bacon, the rich mushroom gravy, the sunny side-up egg, and the rice topped with nori mixture) are great, and when they are all combined in one spoonful, this will surely wake up your taste buds!
