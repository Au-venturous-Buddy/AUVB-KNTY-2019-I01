<h3>Doria (aka Japanese Baked Rice)</h3>
Tori Chizu is known for...you've guessed it…Rice Bowls known as Doria which comes to your table hot from the oven and oozing with gooey cheese! What’s more, these cheesy baked rice bowls come with delicious toppings (including teriyaki chicken, seafood, etc.)! I tried out their Hambagu Doria (which is a cheesy baked rice bowl topped with marinara sauce, a hamburger patty, and parmesan cheese), and, in general, it really tastes very delicious, most especially on the first bite! With that said, I highly recommend that, once the Doria comes to the table, you try to mix 'em all up and eat it immediately since the taste could get boring as the cheese topping loses its ooze.

<h3>Kaarage Chicken (aka Japanese Fried Chicken)</h3>
If you really want a full meal with your Doria, then nothing goes better than a side of Japanese-style Fried Chicken, known more popularly as Kaarage Chicken. At Tori Chizu, their Kaarage Chicken looks crispy and juicy, and a single bite of it, to be honest, is not that different from the usual fried chicken you are familiar with. Plus, they come with gravy (which, for me, was unusual since I’m used to Kaarage Chicken Served with Japanese/Kewpie Mayo).
